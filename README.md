# About this repository


This repository has three projects developed in module 01 of Ignite by Rocketseat. 

### Todo

This was the first challenge of module 01, the Todo List, with which the concepts of Node.JS were put into practice,
rules behind an api rest, https methods, main return codes and types of parameters for a requirement and it was even possible to work with middleware.

### Todo middlewares

In this challenge we used the same application and it was possible to work more deeply with middleware in Express. 

### Repositories

In this challenge we took a Node.JS application that was under development, but with some methods missing, the code was corrected and some methods were written so that the application could pass the tests.
